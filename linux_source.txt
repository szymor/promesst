Promesst Linux Source

This is a Linux port of Sean Barrett's Promesst (http://silverspaceship.com/promesst/),
hacked together by David Gow (http://davidgow.net/). It's far from polished, but it's
playable enough on my computer, which is what matters to me.

The port is based on libSDL-2.0 (http://libsdl.org), and you'll need to link to that
when you compile it (just compile main.c, everything else is included in that).

Almost all of the changes are in the new stb_sdl2graph.h file, though there are a few
changes in the other files. Run 'diff' against the original source to see them: they
should all be pretty obvious. One thing of note was that gluOrtho2D was failing for
some reason I couldn't be bothered to work out at 1 o'clock in the morning, so calls to
it have been replaced with equivalent glOrtho calls.

The included stb_sdl2graph.h might work with other things, but it's pretty unlikely. Only
about half of stb_wingraph's features are implemented, and even those are implemented in
the simplest, hackiest way to get Promesst running. To be honest, it'd probably have been
wiser to just make the game call SDL2 directly rather than trying to implement some of the
quirkier windows API features.

Most importantly, enjoy! The code should, in theory, compile under Mac OS X as well, though
I haven't tried it. Direct questions to david@ingeniumdigital.com or @DyslexicDeity on twitter.
